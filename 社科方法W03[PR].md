### Case analysis 

In recent years, strategies focused on data-driven innovation (DDI) have led to the emergence and development of new products and business models in the digital market. However, these advances have given rise to the development of sophisticated strategies for data management, predicting user behavior, or analyzing their actions. Accordingly, the large-scale analysis of user-generated data (UGD) has led to the emergence of user privacy concerns about how companies manage user data. Although there are some studies on data security, privacy protection, and data-driven strategies, a systematic review on the subject that would focus on both UGD and DDI as main concepts is lacking. Therefore, the present study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the main challenges related to user privacy that affect DDI. The methodology used in the present study unfolds in the following three phases; (i) a systematic literature review (SLR); (ii) in-depth interviews framed in the perspectives of UGD and DDI on user privacy concerns, and finally, (iii) topic-modeling using a Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model to extract insights related to the object of study. Based on the results, we identify 14 topics related to the study of DDI and UGD strategies. In addition, 14 future research questions and 7 research propositions are presented that should be consider for the study of UGD, DDI and user privacy in digital markets. The paper concludes with an important discussion regarding the role of user privacy in DDI in digital markets.

根据综述，数据驱动创新（DDI）被视为数字市场中的新场景，它通过利用用户生成的数据（UGD）来推动新产品和商业模式的出现，而后者则带来了数据安全（data security），隐私保护（privacy protection），数据驱动战略（data-driven strategies）方面的问题。文章着手与此，认为目前尚缺乏一个综述性的研究，来构建DDI和UGD之间的概念联系。

文章的主体结构也在综述中表示得很清晰: 

- 第一部分是做系统性文献综述，
- 第二部分是选择用户隐私保护的视角进行深入访谈，
- 第三是通过Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)的方法建模，然后基于建模识别出14个过去文献中与DDI和UGD研究的核心主题
